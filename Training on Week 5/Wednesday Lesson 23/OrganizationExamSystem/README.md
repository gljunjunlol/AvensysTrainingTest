1) let's design an exam system, to solve the modern days pandemic problem. 
  The organization uses a multiple objective answering system to evaluate the students, but first you need to signup as a student then appear for the exam . 
   
    After completion of the exam it shows the result and the correct answer of the respective questions. 
    But there are two conditions first "one student can appear the exam only once ' and the second one is the admin allows the students to take the exam or not .                      
    ( uses mcq 4 choice,) if b is correct, give mark
      (cannot retake) and (admin need to allow student)
      show the question and score
