III.	Programming Questions (Answer any 4) – (15x4 = 60)
1)	Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.
Input: 
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2

2)	Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 2nd position to 4th position is 12.
 

Example 2:
Input:
N = 10, S = 15
A[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
Output: 1 5
Explanation: The sum of elements 
from 1st position to 5th position
is 15.

3)	Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 
 
Example 1:
Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {3,0,0,2,0,4}
Output:
10
Explanation: 
 

4)	Let the input string be “i like this program very much”. The function should change the string to “much very program this like i”
 
5)	Find whether a string is palindrome or not? 
Example: “121” is palindrome as the reverse of the string is “121” which is same
“ABCDFAB” is not palindrome

6)	Given two numbers find the GCF (Greatest Common Factor) and LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of the two numbers
Example: The GCF and LCM of 3,5 is 1 and 15. The GCF and LCM of 12, 18 is 6 & 36
