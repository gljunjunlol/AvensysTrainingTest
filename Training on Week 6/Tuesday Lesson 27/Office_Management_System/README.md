The super admin , admin , and the user.              
The super admin has all the access to delete the user , create the user and all.        
But the admin can only have access to give task to the users. user just have only on option that is to Log in                       
and see the task he assigned and submit the detailed report of that particular work.          
Use file handling to store all the data
