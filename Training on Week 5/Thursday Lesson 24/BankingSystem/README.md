I want to design a banking system here we perform different banking system operations . 
But all the operations has to be operated by different persons. 
And these operators are to be assigned by the manager everyday. 
you have to go to the bank continuously for one week to execute these following operations 
1. APPLY FOR A LOAN  2. DOCUMENT VERIFICATION 3. NEGOTIATING THE LOAN DETAILS 
4. FINAL APPROVAL AND DEPOSIT  5. WITHDRAWAL OF FUND etc                                  
Now show me the operations and their operator details of the bank for one week.
